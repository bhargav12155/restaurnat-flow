Important:
- Make it feel natural and engaging, not salesy
- ALWAYS include the full website URL https://www.${appUrl} prominently in the post (with https://www. prefix)
- MUST end every post with a call-to-action that includes the contact link. Example endings: "Get started at https://www.${appUrl} or contact us at https://www.imakepage.com/#contact" or "Visit https://www.${appUrl} | Questions? https://www.imakepage.com/#contact"
- Generate 5-8 relevant hashtags separately in the hashtags field — do NOT put them inside the post content
- Do NOT use markdown formatting (no asterisks, no bold, no headers)
- Do NOT start the content with "promote app" or "promote_app".

The LAST LINE of the content MUST be a call-to-action with both links, like:
"Visit https://www.${appUrl} | Contact us: https://www.imakepage.com/#contact"

CRITICAL RESPONSE FORMAT — respond with ONLY this raw JSON, nothing else, no explanation, no markdown, no code block:
{"content": "the post text here — no hashtags inside this string", "hashtags": ["tag1", "tag2", "tag3"]}

Do NOT nest JSON inside the content field. The content value must be a plain text string, not a JSON object.`;
